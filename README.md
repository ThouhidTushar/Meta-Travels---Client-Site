- Medical clinics focus on providing outpatient care. Although hospitals can also provide outpatient services, they focus more on providing inpatient care. This is the type of care where you stay overnight at a medical facility.

- You often go to a hospital to see a specialist, have surgery, or receive care for a serious illness or medical emergency. The services at medical clinics are often focused on routine, preventive, or non-emergency care.

- Medical clinics are usually smaller in size and have a smaller pool of staff. Hospitals typically have a larger workforce of medical professionals, many of whom are specialized in a particular medical field.

- These types of clinics offer primary care services where the cost of care is based on your ability to pay. Find a community health center near you using the HRSA search tool.

- Some medical clinics offer primary care or other types of services for no cost or low cost. The National Association of Free and Charitable Clinics has a search tool to help you find a clinic in your area.
