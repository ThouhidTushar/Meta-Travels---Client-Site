- Meta Travels takes pride in giving the customers a choice of their specific accommodation needs, no matter where – regionally, nationally, and internationally. Certain corporate discounts are available, with preferred accommodation establishments (with bill back facilities).

- Meta Travels provides a complete leisure travel section. The main purpose of this is to serve the exotically tropical islands such as Mauritius , Seychelles and Madagascar .

- Airline packages or any other specials are passed on to our customers. As a common practice at Trip Travel, Trip Travel communicates the “specials” to the customers whenever the specials are received from the airlines.

- Meta Travels provides travel insurance policies provided by AIG, Hollard and TIC.

- Meta Travels provides a 24 hour, 7 day a week emergency service to all customers.
